# Kickstarting with Excel
This excel spreadsheet contains several interesting points of information in regards to successful (and not so successful) kickstarters through a large number of different forms of entertainment.
## Overview of Project
This spreadsheet can be used to further analyze how to manage a successful kickstarter year round for certain forms of media and clothes.
### Purpose
Depending on the goals and amount of time spent on gaining backers(aka funding), a person looking to kickstart a play/musical/television show can gather some insight on the goal amount and when to begin.
## Analysis and Challenges

Looking at the graph above you can see that a Theater show has a greater chance of success in the warmer climate areas. Using this information we can help other kickstarting efforts get ahead when deciding to go public with their idea.
     
A possible challenge would be for a book writer who is hoping to gain information on kickstarter goal ideas. The information is limited for kickstarters who wish to help fund a book and the specific category that book is in even further restricts the information that can be pulled from this spreadsheet.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 When looking at the "Outcomes based on Launch Date" line chart. We can conclude that theater kickstarters have a better chance of success if they are funded during the end of Spring up until the end of Summer. Probably due to weather conditions being more optimal to go places. Second we can state that based on the information in the chart,you should not start a Theater Kickstarter campaign in December. This is because December is the only month to show a significant drop in Successful campaigns while simultaneously an increase in failed outcomes. Every other month on our graph has the successful and failed campaign lines flowing in the same direction relatively speaking (they both either go up or down for the month).
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 If you look at the Outcomes Based on Goals Sheet, you can see that Plays that were kickstarted with a goal of $20,000 or less had a 50% chance of success. But the chance of success increased when the kickstarter met its goal of less than 5,000. That increased the potential to be successfully funded to 75%.
## Results
 
After looking further into the data I can see that for someone looking to kickstart a project that required a significant money investment and higher goal, they may not be able to gather enough help as a lot of the higher budgeted kickstarters failed.
 
If we wanted to prepare another table of all the failed kickstarters over all different categories, it may help gather data on which largely funded projects were more likely to be successful.
